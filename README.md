# Caravan

## Trivia

"Caravan" is an American jazz standard that was composed by Juan Tizol and Duke Ellington and first performed by Ellington in 1936. Irving Mills wrote lyrics, but they are rarely sung. The song is in the key of F major and is in 4/4 time. The tempo is 120 beats per minute. The song is in the form of a 32-bar AABA song.

In the recent times, the song was popularized by a 2014 American independent psychological drama film written and directed by Damien Chazelle and starring Miles Teller, J.K. Simmons, Paul Reiser and Melissa Benoist. The film expores a toxic relationship between a young jazz drumer, Andrew Neiman (played by Miles Teller), and his demanding music instructor, Terence Fletcher (played by J.K. Simmons)[1](https://youtu.be/ZZY-Ytrw2co)
